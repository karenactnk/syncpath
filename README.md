# SyncPath

SyncPath is a Python program designed to assist developers in compiling and running scripts efficiently on Windows platforms. It aims to enhance developer productivity by automating common tasks related to script execution.

## Features

- **Compile Scripts**: Check Python script syntax before execution to prevent runtime errors.
- **Run Scripts**: Execute scripts directly from the command line.
- **Directory Management**: Easily change directories and reset to the original directory after execution.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your Windows machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

2. Clone this repository or download the `syncpath.py` file to your local machine.

## Usage

Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `syncpath.py` file. Use the following command to compile and run a script:

```

Replace `<script_path>` with the path to the script you want to compile and run.

### Example
